# research sufficiently for showing relevancy to machine learning engineering
additional details are not currently having a known plan concerning machine learning engineering.
## implementation details 
This project is meant to help with fearless SIMD in Rust.
Some rust code will likely be implemented in this project.
The use of my own private resources is not an unexpected possibility to avoid.
I guess that may involve using rust code in this repository to 
connect directly with my private resource(s).
The purpose is to help with fearless SIMD.
