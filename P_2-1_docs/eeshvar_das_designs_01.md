Major bug on GitHub is preventing the GitHub UI from allowing some types of commits directly to repositories.
# My designs will have a link to an external source
where i can do vcs off of GitHub. This probably won't affect the ability to make pull requests,
so I am going to use vcs elsewhere and then likely put any pull requests in one batch from my other vcs.
