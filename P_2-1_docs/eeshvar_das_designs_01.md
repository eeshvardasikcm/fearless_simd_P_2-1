Major bug on GitHub is preventing the GitHub UI from allowing some types of commits directly to repositories.
# My designs will have a link to an external source
where i can do vcs off of GitHub. This probably won't affect the ability to make pull requests,
so I am going to use vcs elsewhere and then likely put any pull requests in one batch from my other vcs.
## link(s) to my designs 
* I modified the specifications slightly on my designs. This modification will likely lead to more members in the Precision set. The point that was missed so far is that this #4 issue (proposal) appears to be interested in safe math, while also maximizing optimization. I think a major point is that the floating point calculations in rust are not rounded accurately according to mathematics. This may be a permissable behavior according to standardized floating point specifications. The rounding adjustements in the #4 proposal appear to be an effort to get safe math floating point results that are mathematically correct. I added a Precision value that should be used in the case that standardized floating point results are still not giving the exact mathematical answer. This addition will likely be followed by a safe math suffix 'S' being placed at every precision specifcation, indicating that safe math with exact answers are required. This could get interesting
