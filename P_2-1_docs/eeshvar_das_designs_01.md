Major bug on GitHub is preventing the GitHub UI from allowing some types of commits directly to repositories.
# My designs will have a link to an external source
where i can do vcs off of GitHub. This probably won't affect the ability to make pull requests,
so I am going to use vcs elsewhere and then likely put any pull requests in one batch from my other vcs.
## link(s) to my designs 
* six axioms created with P_0S in mind.
* next up from this [r02] of the first major draft would be to discover or create an axiom.
* Now that this latest [r02] of the first final draft appears to have this description below attached to the [r02] revision of my design, it appears there is room for a sedond vector in the vector space. This might be the exact revision necessary to have taken this design beyond the looking glass of the fearless SIMD #4 issue (proposal). The objective of my design is to attempt reducing toil. It may be a good idea to declare an initiative to begin first implementation of my design starting at this [r02] of the first final draft.
* naming convention for my designs is good up to this point. The second final draft can have a suffix 'd2' added before the revision number 'r##'.
* I modified the specifications slightly on my designs. This modification will likely lead to more members in the Precision set. The point that was missed so far is that this #4 issue (proposal) appears to be interested in safe math, while also maximizing optimization. I think a major point is that the floating point calculations in rust are not rounded accurately according to mathematics. This may be a permissable behavior according to standardized floating point specifications. The rounding adjustements in the #4 proposal appear to be an effort to get safe math floating point results that are mathematically correct. I added a Precision value that should be used in the case that standardized floating point results are still not giving the exact mathematical answer. This addition will likely be followed by a safe math suffix 'S' being placed at every precision specifcation, indicating that safe math with exact answers are required. This could get interesting as the precision becomes relaxed and highly relaxed. There may have to be more specific relaxed and highly relaxed members added to the Precision specifications. The most obvious is that highly relaxed can allow for extremely optimized calculations that have the result of a three (for example significant digit safe math value. This new P_0S member to the Precision specifications set also allows for thinking in terms of grade school three digit multiplication,
