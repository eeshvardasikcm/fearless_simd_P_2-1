Major bug on GitHub is preventing the GitHub UI from allowing some types of commits directly to repositories.
# My designs will have a link to an external source
where i can do vcs off of GitHub. This probably won't affect the ability to make pull requests,
so I am going to use vcs elsewhere and then likely put any pull requests in one batch from my other vcs.
## link(s) to my designs 
* second set of axioms completed. these first two axiom sets are my own thoughts and are for getting comfortable with the axiom creation process. have not made axioms that have IEEE guarantee yet.
* updates to the [r02](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1snBYw8Pq-u_TY1w4keyFxD6Yx-L2-tNa/view) of my first final draft are not envisioned at this present moment.
I think I might be relaxing more over the next few days. That was a lot of work to get this design done.
