Major bug on GitHub is preventing the GitHub UI from allowing some types of commits directly to repositories.
# My designs will have a link to an external source
where i can do vcs off of GitHub. This probably won't affect the ability to make pull requests,
so I am going to use vcs elsewhere and then likely put any pull requests in one batch from my other vcs.
## link(s) to my designs 
* now that the axiom sets are almost finalized in their first draft form, it is important to begin
clarifying privacy concerns. a privacy policy likely won't be written until at least the
completion of the third axiom set. Privacy thoughts begin with the fact that
any data uploaded to my resources through a rust code boilerplate in this fork
will not be held for processing more than only a short time before the results are
posted for public view in my designed charting of rusts fearless simd capabilities.
automated validations may continue, but the design of the first input vector should be
sufficient in not requiring any new uploaded data to process regular automated validations.
updates to the raphlevien fearless simd repository and my fork,
can be synced into my resources regularly
without the need for any new data transfers to my resources.
* creation began of third and final set of axioms.
* second set of axioms completed. these first two axiom sets are my own thoughts and are for getting comfortable with the axiom creation process. have not made axioms that have IEEE guarantee yet.
* updates to the [r02](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1snBYw8Pq-u_TY1w4keyFxD6Yx-L2-tNa/view) of my first final draft are not envisioned at this present moment.
I think I might be relaxing more over the next few days. That was a lot of work to get this design done.
