# Eeshvar Das Fearless SIMD Axiom One
not discovered or created yet.
It's probably best if this axiom will favor reducing toil in the 
primary portions of axiom construction and discovery.
Because of the fact that this fork is based from 
the active fearless SIMD rust repository,
and I forked deriving from #4 issue (proposal),
this axiom should also have the 
initial mathematics functionality 
proposed in #4 proposal;
intention also being part of the primary portions of this axiom.
