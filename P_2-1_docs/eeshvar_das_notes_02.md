# implementation of design
some implementation in rust of the method design I created may need to be done.
My thinking is that this may show some computer science competency in this context.
The implementation process will likely 
follow along with the 
implementation process of the repository that this fork is from.
Implementing along with issue #4 from that fearless SIMD repository is likely the 
proposal that I will implement along first.
Implemting more advanced precision (P_3) using 
my highly relaxed precision design can be an option for later implementation.
## derived design 
my design is derived directly from the repository that this is a fork of.
I will have to understand 
that the designer/owner of that main fearless SIMD repository 
may have already designed or intended to design the designs I have made.
I will have to make specific details 
according to the licensing of that main fearless SIMD repository 
attempting to follow licenses accordingly.
