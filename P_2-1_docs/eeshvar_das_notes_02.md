# implementation of design
some implementation in rust of the method design I created may need to be done.
My thinking is that this may show some computer science competency in this context.
The implementation process will likely 
follow along with the 
implementation process of the repository that this fork is from.
Implementing along with issue #4 from that fearless SIMD repository is likely the 
proposal that I will implement along first.
Implemting more advanced precision (P_3) using 
my highly relaxed precision design can be an option for later implementation.
